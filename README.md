# League of Legends Match Data Analysis

## üìÑ Overview
This project analyzes **League of Legends** match data to uncover key gameplay insights.  
The workflow covers **data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, and **interactive Power BI dashboard** creation to visualize performance trends and metrics.

The dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle**, and **ChatGPT** was used as a coding assistant for some Python-related tasks.

## üîç Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Integration
- Downloaded raw match data from Kaggle.
- Gathered multiple CSV files containing match statistics.
- Merged all datasets into a single consolidated file for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)
- Removed duplicate entries and irrelevant columns.
- Handled missing values.
- Standardized column names and data formats.
- Used ChatGPT to assist with some Python code snippets.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Calculated aggregated statistics such as win rate, kills, deaths, and assists.
- Identified trends and patterns using descriptive statistics and group analysis.

### 4. Interactive Analysis & Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
- Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
- Created multiple interactive visuals to analyze metrics by different dimensions (e.g., team side, champion, game duration).
- Used slicers and filters for dynamic exploration.
- Designed a clean dashboard layout to visualize KPIs such as win rate, average kills/deaths/assists, and match distribution.

## üìä Key Insights
- **Champion Balance:** Certain champions have a significantly higher win rate, suggesting they may be overpowered.
- **Top Kill Champions:** Identified champions with the highest average kills per match.
- **Vision Control Impact:** More wards placed = higher win probability.
- **Team Side Advantage:** Blue side teams win more matches compared to red side teams.
- **Minion Kills Correlation:** Higher CS correlates with higher win rates.
- **Gold Advantage:** Winning teams usually have a higher total gold.
- **ADC Role Performance:** ADC champions often achieve the highest kills.
